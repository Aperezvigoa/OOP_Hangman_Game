# ðŸŽ® Hangman Game

Welcome to the **Hangman Game** project! This project is a console-based implementation of the classic word-guessing game. It's designed for educational purposes, showcasing principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) and clean code practices.

## ðŸ“– Overview

The Hangman Game allows players to guess letters to uncover a hidden word, with a limited number of attempts. It's a great example of how to break down a larger application into smaller, reusable components.

## ðŸ›  Features

- **Random Word Selection**: Words are randomly chosen from an external file.
- **Dynamic Game State**: Tracks user guesses, displays the current state of the word, and shows the remaining attempts.
- **Customizable Attempts**: Change the maximum number of attempts easily.
- **ASCII Art**: Visual representation of the hangman as the game progresses.
- **Clean and Modular Design**: Built with multiple classes, each with a specific responsibility.
